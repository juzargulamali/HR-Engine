-- READ-ONLY. Run in the SQL Editor of "Enginious HR Engine_V2" AFTER the migration 20261216000800_letters_storage_issued_only.sql.
-- Run the WHOLE file; it returns ONE table (check | item | result | detail). Every row of the "result" column must say OK (or INFO, which is information only).
-- A row that says FAIL means stop and send me the whole result. It creates, changes and deletes nothing.
--
--   1  the functions exist, are SECURITY DEFINER with a fixed search path; the added ones are callable by signed-in users and NOT by anonymous visitors; the internal
--      helpers are callable by nobody signed in
--   2  the new rule is in the function text AND every earlier protection is still there
--   3  the privilege / policy part of the change, where this migration has one
--
-- It checks DEFINITIONS and PRIVILEGES. It cannot call a function without writing or acting as a person, so the behaviour is proved by the repository's database tests
-- (packages/rls-tests/test/letters_pending_storage.rls.test.ts) and, on this project, by the first real use (see the deployment guide).
